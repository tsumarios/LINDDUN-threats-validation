## Abstract

The protection of privacy has emerged as a paramount concern from rapid technological advancements and interconnected devices. As individuals engage with innovative technologies, such as smart cars and smart homes, the need to comprehensively address privacy threats becomes increasingly critical. This paper recognises the relevance of privacy threat modelling, especially under the umbrella of GDPR compliance, and considers the challenge of the pursuit of completeness in eliciting privacy threats.

This paper advances the SPADA privacy threat modelling methodology to guide analysts in making informed decisions, ensuring a well-rounded assessment of privacy risks. The SPADA methodology revolves around five key variables - document source, privacy property, threat agents, application domain, and level of detail.
The SPADA methodology is applied to the relevant domains of automotive and smart home considering both soft and hard privacy. This yielded 23 domain-independent threats for soft privacy, and 29 domain-independent threats for hard privacy. Both these lists of threats were then tailored to 43 assets to become automotive domain-dependent and to 127 assets to become smart home domain-dependent.
